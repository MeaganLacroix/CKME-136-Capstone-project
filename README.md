# CKME-136-Capstone-project
The data for this project comes from https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment/kernels (Fisman, R., Iyengar, S. S., Kamenica, E. & Simonson, I. (2006), “Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence from a Speed Dating Experiment”, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121, 673 – 697). 
The spread sheet labeled Speed_Dating is the original dataset curated by Fismen et al. (2006).
Clean_2 is the rmarkdown document where I cleaned the Speed_Dating dataset.
Summarizing_variables is the rmarkdown document where correlations are explored for the variables in the dataset and assumptions are tested for the dependent variable.
Creating_models is the rmarkdown document where predictive models are created from the final train and test datasets.
